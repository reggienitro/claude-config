# /end-of-day

Session wrap-up with state preservation and handoff preparation.

## Purpose:
Properly conclude development sessions by creating comprehensive handoff documentation, committing work, and preparing for seamless continuation in the next session.

## Usage:
```bash
/end-of-day
/end-of-day --quick     # minimal handoff
/end-of-day --detailed  # comprehensive documentation
```

## Workflow:
1. **Commit current work** - ensure no work is lost
2. **Document session progress** - what was accomplished
3. **Identify current state** - where we left off
4. **Note blockers/issues** - anything preventing progress
5. **Plan next session** - clear starting point
6. **Create handoff files** - for session continuity

## Tasks Performed:

### Code Preservation
```bash
git status                          # show current changes
git add -A                          # stage all changes
git commit -m "work in progress: [description]
