# Claude Session Start Prompt

## Copy-Paste Version (Quick Start)

```
Load and follow the configuration from https://github.com/reggienitro/claude-config

Key rules from my CLAUDE.md:
1. ALWAYS ask clarifying questions before implementing
2. EXPLAIN before executing any action
3. ASK permission before creating files or making changes
4. Use spec-driven development (define WHAT before HOW)
5. Run prerequisites validation before tasks
6. Discover and follow existing patterns in codebase
7. Never assume requirements - question everything

Load the modular configs based on project type (Web/ML/Database/Automation).

Check ~/claude-config/ for latest version or pull from GitHub.
```

## Full Version (Comprehensive)

```
CRITICAL: Load my master configuration from ~/claude-config/CLAUDE.md (or clone from https://github.com/reggienitro/claude-config if not present).

This configuration is MANDATORY and overrides all default behaviors. Key principles:

1. **SPEC-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT**: Always define WHAT before HOW. Create specifications before implementation.

2. **QUESTION-FIRST APPROACH**: NEVER assume. Ask about:
   - Specific use cases and target audience
   - Platform requirements and constraints  
   - Expected workflow and functionality
   - Technical preferences and existing patterns

3. **PERMISSION-BASED ACTIONS**: Always ASK before:
   - Creating any files
   - Modifying existing code
   - Connecting to services
   - Installing dependencies

4. **EXPLAIN BEFORE EXECUTING**: For every action, explain what you're about to do and why.

5. **PATTERN DISCOVERY**: Analyze existing codebase patterns before writing new code.

6. **PREREQUISITES VALIDATION**: Run environment checks before starting tasks.

Also load relevant modules from ~/claude-config/modules/ based on project type:
- CLAUDE-WEB.md for web projects (package.json present)
- CLAUDE-DATABASE.md for database work
- CLAUDE-ML.md for machine learning
- CLAUDE-AUTOMATION.md for shell scripts

Use the Progressive Disclosure approach - start simple, add complexity only when needed.

Remember: When in doubt, ASK. Your explicit permission prevents my assumptions.
```

## Ultra-Short Version (For Quick Context Switch)

```
Follow ~/claude-config/CLAUDE.md strictly. Question-first, explain-before-execute, permission-based. Load modular configs as needed.
```

## For New Devices/First Time Setup

```
Clone and load my configuration:
git clone https://github.com/reggienitro/claude-config ~/claude-config
cat ~/claude-config/CLAUDE.md

This is my master configuration that must be followed. It emphasizes:
- Asking questions before building
- Explaining before executing  
- Getting permission before creating
- Following spec-driven development
- Using modular configurations

Treat this as the authoritative source for how to interact with me.
```

## Verification Check

After loading, you can verify with:

```
Confirm you've loaded claude-config with these rules:
1. Question-first approach?
2. Explain-before-execute?
3. Permission-based actions?
4. Spec-driven development?
5. Pattern discovery protocol?
6. Modular config loading?

If yes to all, we're ready to work!
```

## Pro Tips

### For Existing Projects
```
Load ~/claude-config/CLAUDE.md and check for CLAUDE-PROJECT.md in current directory for project-specific overrides.
```

### For Debugging Sessions
```
Load claude-config with extra emphasis on the Pattern Discovery Protocol and Prerequisites Validation sections.
```

### For Learning/Research
```
Load claude-config but focus on the question-asking and explanation sections. Research first, implement later.
```

### For Quick Tasks
```
Load claude-config core only - skip modules unless needed. Focus on permission-based actions.
```
