# SESSION HANDOFF: AI Self-Correction System Implementation

## CRITICAL SESSION RESTART INSTRUCTIONS

### **IMMEDIATE FIRST ACTIONS FOR NEW SESSION:**

1. **Clone and Load Configuration**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/aettefagh
   git clone https://github.com/reggienitro/claude-config.git claude-config-work
   # OR if already exists:
   cd /Users/aettefagh/claude-config-work && git pull
   ```

2. **MANDATORY: Load CLAUDE.md Configuration**
   - The claude-config repo contains CRITICAL behavioral instructions
   - **MUST FOLLOW**: All guidelines in CLAUDE.md, especially the self-correction module
   - **CORE PRINCIPLE**: ALWAYS ASK CLARIFYING QUESTIONS before ANY implementation
   - **NEVER ASSUME**: Requirements, functionality, platforms, or user preferences

### **PROJECT CONTEXT: AI Self-Correction System**

**WHAT WE JUST COMPLETED:**
- ✅ Designed violation detection patterns for guideline violations
- ✅ Created auto-correction triggers and response templates  
- ✅ Built invisible background monitoring system (NO dashboards)
- ✅ Created self-correction module at `.claude/modules/self-correction.md`
- ✅ Updated main CLAUDE.md to import the self-correction module
- ✅ Committed and deployed to claude-config repo (commit: feeef6d)

**SYSTEM OVERVIEW:**
The self-correction system we built provides:

1. **Silent Violation Detection**
   - Monitors for implementation without questions
   - Detects assumption language patterns
   - Identifies requirements bypass attempts
   - Auto-detects violation keywords like "I'll build...", "I assume...", etc.

2. **Invisible Auto-Correction**
   - Silent redirection from solutions to questions (default behavior)
   - Escalated correction only when user notices patterns
   - Critical override requiring user approval only for major course corrections

3. **Background Monitoring**
   - Internal self-assessment every 3 exchanges
   - Tracks question-to-solution ratio, assumption frequency
   - NO user-visible dashboards or metrics (per user requirement)

### **KEY FILES CREATED/MODIFIED:**

**New File:** `/Users/aettefagh/claude-config-work/.claude/modules/self-correction.md`
- Contains violation detection patterns
- Auto-correction protocols and templates
- Background monitoring rules
- Response templates for redirecting to questions

**Modified File:** `/Users/aettefagh/claude-config-work/CLAUDE.md`
- Added import for self-correction module at top of imports list
- Now automatically loads self-correction behavior

### **CURRENT PROJECT STATUS:**

**COMPLETED WORK:**
- Self-correction system is LIVE and deployed
- Available at: https://github.com/reggienitro/claude-config
- System automatically enforces questioning requirements
- Works invisibly without user-facing dashboards

**SYSTEM BEHAVIOR:**
The AI now automatically:
- Redirects from implementation to questions when violations detected
- Uses response templates to ensure consistent questioning
- Operates completely in background (per user requirements)
- Only escalates to user approval for major corrections

### **USER REQUIREMENTS THAT MUST BE MAINTAINED:**

1. **No Dashboards or Visible Monitoring**
   - User explicitly stated: "I don't need any kind of dashboard"
   - All monitoring must be behind the scenes
   - Simple workflow: Start Claude → Load config → Start project

2. **User Approval for Major Changes Only**
   - User specifically stated: "I don't want to reset any sessions or restart anything without user approval first"
   - Only escalate to user for critical course corrections
   - Default to silent redirection and background operation

3. **Core Enforcement Principles**
   - ALWAYS ask clarifying questions before implementation
   - NEVER assume requirements
   - Challenge user thinking and present alternatives
   - Question everything: use case, audience, platforms, workflow

### **NEXT SESSION WORKFLOW:**

When resuming work:

1. **Load Configuration First**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/aettefagh/claude-config-work
   # Review current CLAUDE.md configuration
   # Confirm self-correction module is active
   ```

2. **Verify System Deployment**
   - Confirm changes are live in GitHub repo
   - Check that CLAUDE.md imports self-correction module
   - Validate all behavioral guidelines are loaded

3. **Test Self-Correction Behavior**
   - AI should automatically ask questions before implementing
   - Should challenge assumptions and present alternatives  
   - Should operate invisibly without showing monitoring

### **IMPORTANT BEHAVIORAL NOTES:**

**FOR AI IN NEXT SESSION:**
- **CRITICAL**: You MUST load and follow ALL claude-config guidelines
- The self-correction system is now part of your core behavior
- Ask clarifying questions BEFORE any implementation work
- Challenge user assumptions and present alternatives
- Operate monitoring invisibly - no dashboards or visible metrics
- Only escalate to user approval for major course corrections

**VIOLATION PATTERNS TO AVOID:**
- ❌ "I'll help you build..." without questions first
- ❌ "Let me create..." without requirements gathering
- ❌ "Here's a typical implementation..." without context
- ❌ "I assume you want..." without clarification
- ❌ Starting code generation without 3+ clarifying questions

**CORRECT BEHAVIOR PATTERNS:**
- ✅ "Before I suggest an implementation, help me understand..."
- ✅ "What specific use case do you have for..."
- ✅ "What technical constraints should I be aware of..."
- ✅ "Have you considered [alternative] approach instead..."

### **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:**

**Self-Correction Module Features:**
- Automatic violation detection based on keyword patterns
- Silent redirection templates for common violations
- Background monitoring without user-visible output
- Escalation protocols requiring user approval
- Response templates for consistent questioning behavior

**Integration Method:**
- Module is imported at top of CLAUDE.md imports list
- Automatically loaded with claude-config system
- No additional setup required by user
- Works transparently in background

### **SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR NEXT SESSION:**

1. **Configuration Loading**: AI successfully loads claude-config guidelines
2. **Behavioral Compliance**: AI asks questions before implementing  
3. **Invisible Operation**: No dashboards or visible monitoring displayed
4. **Appropriate Escalation**: Only seeks user approval for major corrections
5. **Consistent Enforcement**: Maintains questioning behavior throughout session

### **CONTINUATION COMMAND FOR NEW SESSION:**

```
RESTART PROMPT:
"Load configuration from https://github.com/reggienitro/claude-config and continue our work on the AI self-correction system. The system has been completed and deployed. Follow all behavioral guidelines in CLAUDE.md including the new self-correction module. Ask clarifying questions before any implementation work."
```
